To ensure that specific watchers are deployed to specific environments (TST, ACC, PRD) using your existing Python pipelines and Jinja templates, you can implement environment-specific logic in your deployment process. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Categorize Watchers by Environment
First, identify which watchers should be deployed to each environment. Create a mapping or configuration file that specifies which watchers belong to TST, ACC, and PRD. For example, you can use a YAML or JSON file to define this mapping:

Example YAML File (watcher_config.yaml):
yaml
Copy Code
TST:
  - watcher1
  - watcher2
ACC:
  - watcher3
  - watcher4
PRD:
  - watcher5
  - watcher6
This file will act as a reference for your pipeline to determine which watchers to deploy to each environment.

2. Update Your Python Pipeline
Modify your Python pipeline to read the configuration file and deploy only the watchers specified for the target environment.

Example Python Code:
python
Execute
Copy Code
import yaml

# Load watcher configuration
def load_watcher_config(config_file):
    with open(config_file, 'r') as file:
        return yaml.safe_load(file)

# Deploy watchers to the specified environment
def deploy_watchers(environment, watcher_config):
    if environment not in watcher_config:
        raise ValueError(f"Environment '{environment}' not found in configuration.")

    watchers_to_deploy = watcher_config[environment]
    print(f"Deploying the following watchers to {environment}: {watchers_to_deploy}")

    for watcher in watchers_to_deploy:
        # Add your deployment logic here
        print(f"Deploying watcher: {watcher}")
        # Example: deploy_watcher_to_elk(environment, watcher)

# Main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    config_file = "watcher_config.yaml"
    target_environment = "TST"  # Change this dynamically based on your pipeline input

    watcher_config = load_watcher_config(config_file)
    deploy_watchers(target_environment, watcher_config)
This script reads the watcher_config.yaml file, determines which watchers to deploy based on the target environment, and deploys them accordingly.

3. Use Jinja Templates for Watcher Configuration
If your watchers are defined using Jinja templates, you can pass the environment as a variable to the template and conditionally include or exclude specific watchers.

Example Jinja Template (watcher_template.j2):
jinja
Copy Code
{% if environment == "TST" %}
# Watcher1 configuration for TST
watcher1:
  trigger: ...
  actions: ...
# Watcher2 configuration for TST
watcher2:
  trigger: ...
  actions: ...
{% elif environment == "ACC" %}
# Watcher3 configuration for ACC
watcher3:
  trigger: ...
  actions: ...
# Watcher4 configuration for ACC
watcher4:
  trigger: ...
  actions: ...
{% elif environment == "PRD" %}
# Watcher5 configuration for PRD
watcher5:
  trigger: ...
  actions: ...
# Watcher6 configuration for PRD
watcher6:
  trigger: ...
  actions: ...
{% endif %}
You can render this template in Python by passing the target environment as a variable:

Example Python Code for Rendering Jinja Template:
python
Execute
Copy Code
from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader

# Render Jinja template
def render_template(environment, template_file, output_file):
    env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader('.'))
    template = env.get_template(template_file)
    rendered_content = template.render(environment=environment)

    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        file.write(rendered_content)
    print(f"Rendered template for {environment} written to {output_file}")

# Main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    target_environment = "TST"  # Change this dynamically based on your pipeline input
    template_file = "watcher_template.j2"
    output_file = f"watcher_{target_environment}.json"

    render_template(target_environment, template_file, output_file)
This approach ensures that only the relevant watchers are included in the configuration for the target environment.

4. Automate Deployment in Your Pipeline
Integrate the above logic into your pipeline. For each environment (TST, ACC, PRD), the pipeline should:

Load the watcher configuration or render the Jinja template.
Deploy the watchers specific to that environment.
You can use environment variables, command-line arguments, or CI/CD pipeline parameters to dynamically specify the target environment during deployment.

5. Validate Deployment
To ensure correctness:

Test the pipeline for each environment (TST, ACC, PRD) to verify that only the intended watchers are deployed.
Log the deployment process to track which watchers were deployed to which environment.
By following this approach, you can ensure that specific watchers are deployed to their respective environments while maintaining flexibility and scalability in your pipeline.
