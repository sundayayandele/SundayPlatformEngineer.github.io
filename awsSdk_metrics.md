# Metric Combinations to Highlight
- Latency vs Error Rate: Correlate increased latency (awsSdk_HttpClient_Latency) with error rates (awsSdk_HttpClient_ErrorCount) to identify bottlenecks.
- Retries vs Throttling: Compare retry counts (awsSdk_Api_RetryCount) with throttling events (awsSdk_Api_ThrottlingErrorCount) to assess API limits.
- Success vs Failure by Operation: Use awsSdk_Api_SuccessCount and awsSdk_Api_ErrorCount to evaluate API-level performance.
 - Throughput vs Latency: Analyze throughput (awsSdk_Api_BytesIn/BytesOut) against latency to identify data transfer inefficiencies.
## This dashboard layout will provide a comprehensive view of S3 performance, helping you monitor system health and identify potential issues effectively.

### Suggested Dashboard Layout
- Header Section:
