To deploy specific watchers to specific environments (TST, ACC, and PRD) using your existing Python and Jinja setup, you can implement the following steps:

1. Organize Watchers by Environment
Create separate directories for each environment:
watchers/
├── tst/
├── acc/
└── prd/
Place environment-specific watcher configurations in their respective directories.
2. Modify Your Python Deployment Script
Use the ENVIRONMENT variable to determine which directory to deploy from.
Update your deployment script to dynamically select the appropriate watcher configuration files based on the environment.
3. Use Jinja to Template Watchers
Use Jinja templates to dynamically generate watcher configurations based on environment-specific variables.
Example:
python
Copy Code
from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader

env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader('watchers/{}'.format(ENVIRONMENT)))
template = env.get_template('watcher-config.json.j2')
watcher_config = template.render(environment_vars)
4. Implement Environment-Specific Deployment Logic
Modify your pipeline to accept an ENVIRONMENT parameter.
Deploy watchers only for the specified environment.
Example Directory Structure
watchers/
├── tst/
│   └── watcher-tst.json
├── acc/
│   └── watcher-acc.json
└── prd/
    └── watcher-prd.json
Example Deployment Script
python
Execute
Copy Code
import os
from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader

# Set the environment variable
ENVIRONMENT = os.getenv('ENVIRONMENT', 'tst')

# Load the appropriate watcher configuration for the environment
watcher_dir = f'watchers/{ENVIRONMENT}'
env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader(watcher_dir))
template = env.get_template('watcher-config.json.j2')

# Render the template with environment-specific variables
watcher_config = template.render(environment_vars)

# Deploy the watcher configuration to the appropriate ELK cluster
deploy_watcher_to_elk(watcher_config, ENVIRONMENT)
5. Use a Configuration File
Create a config.yaml file that maps environments to their respective watcher configurations.
Example:
yaml
Copy Code
environments:
  tst:
    - watcher1
    - watcher2
  acc:
    - watcher3
    - watcher4
  prd:
    - watcher5
Use this configuration file in your deployment script to determine which watchers to deploy.
6. Error Handling and Validation
Ensure that the deployment script validates the environment and watcher configurations before deploying.
Raise an error if the environment is not recognized or if the watcher configuration is missing.
7. Automate with CI/CD Pipelines
Use your CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process for each environment.
Parameterize the environment variable so that the pipeline can be triggered with the appropriate environment parameter.
By implementing these steps, you can ensure that specific watchers are deployed to specific environments, maintaining separation and consistency across your TST, ACC, and PRD environments.
