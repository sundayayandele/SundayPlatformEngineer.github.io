Yes! Based on your xyz.json configuration, your Grafana dashboard will support filtering by the job parameter dynamically in a Single View Dashboard. However, there are a few fixes and improvements needed to make sure this works correctly.

‚úÖ How to Make $job Work as a Search Parameter

To ensure the job variable works dynamically in Grafana, follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Fix the JSON Query for job

Your current JSON:

"variables": {
  "Job": {
    "type": "query",
    "query": "api_response_time_seconds_count{job=~\"$job\"}",
    "label": "job"
  }
}

Issues:

The query is using job=~"$job", but $job is not defined yet.

The job filter is missing a PromQL function that fetches unique job names.


‚úÖ Fixed Query:

"variables": {
  "Job": {
    "type": "query",
    "query": "label_values(api_response_time_seconds_count, job)",
    "label": "job"
  }
}

label_values(api_response_time_seconds_count, job) ‚Üí Fetches all unique job labels dynamically.

Now, $job will auto-populate with available jobs in Grafana.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Use $job in Your Panels

Now that $job is correctly defined, use it dynamically in your Prometheus queries inside Grafana panels:

prometheus.query.new(
  '$' + variable.datasource.name, 
  '1 - (sum by (httpStatusCode, method) (rate(api_response_time_seconds_count{httpStatusCode=~"2..", job=~"$job"}[5m])) ' +
  '/ sum by (httpStatusCode, method) (rate(api_response_time_seconds_count{job=~"$job"}[5m])))'
)

Uses job=~"$job" to filter based on the selected job.

If (All) is selected, it automatically includes all jobs.



---

3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure the Template Supports variables

Inside your template.abc.libsonnet, make sure variables are passed into the dashboard:

local grafana = import 'grafonnet/grafana.libsonnet';

grafana.dashboard.new('API Monitoring Dashboard')
.withVariable(
  grafana.template.datasource.new('job')
  .withQuery('label_values(api_response_time_seconds_count, job)')
  .withAllValue('*')  // Enables wildcard (all jobs)
)
.withPanels([
    grafana.panels.stat.new('API Error Rate')
    .withPrometheusTarget('sum by (httpStatusCode, method) (rate(api_response_time_seconds_count{httpStatusCode=~"2..", job=~"$job"}[5m]))')
    .setGridPos({x: 0, y: 0, w: 12, h: 8})
])

.withVariable(...) ensures $job exists.

.withAllValue('*') enables the "All" selection.

üéØ How $job Works in Grafana

1. The "job" dropdown appears in Grafana‚Äôs UI.


2. Users select a job, and $job updates dynamically.


3. The dashboard updates automatically to show data only for the selected job.



üí° Bonus: If you want users to select multiple jobs, enable multi-selection in Grafana's variable settings.

üöÄ Final Summary

‚úÖ Fixes $job query using label_values(...)
‚úÖ Ensures Prometheus queries use $job dynamically
‚úÖ Uses $job in the template and panels
‚úÖ Supports wildcard selection (All jobs)

With this setup, $job will work dynamically as a search filter in the Single View Dashboard in Grafana! üéØ
